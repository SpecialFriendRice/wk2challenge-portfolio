# Interactive portfolio for Module 2 challenge

This webpage with interactive links was created for the second challenge of the EdX Front End Web Development bootcamp and intended as a springboard for future use. Outline starter code was modified to make a simple portfolio page with examples of coding work and contact details for a developer in training.

## Description

Portfolios are a key part of applying for work as a developer and images of deployed apps, along with links to their repositories on GitHub are what employers will be looking for. A section for contact details with interactive links, and nav elements in the header of a page are basic features that help your portfolio page stand out.
